# AtliQ Technologies Revenue Data Analysis :

The purpose of the project was to unlock sales insights which were not visible before the sales team for decision support and automate them to reduce manual time spent in data gathering.

# Problem statement:
The case study was based on a computer hardware business company "AtliQ Technologies" which was facing challenges in dynamically changing market. Sales director decided to invest in data analysis project and he wanted to build Tableau dashboard that could then give him real time sales insights. 

# Project planning and data discovery aspect:

After the sales directory of atliQhardware had decided to invest in data analysis project he did a meeting with ITdirector, data analytics team to come up with a plan. They used the AIMS grid todefine the purpose and success criteria of this project. Once AIMS grid was defined,next step was data discovery. In this step, data analyst team approached IT team(within the organization) who owns the software system that kept the track of salesrecords. These records were stored in MySQL database. Tableau was then plugged to this database to pull necessary information required for data analysis. We often need separate data warehouse or OLAP system to run our data analytics queries but in this project we directly used MySQL database.
This database had all the sales transactions,customers, products and markets information. We analyzed this database and then tied it up with Tableau. In the Tableau software we performed ETL (extract transform load). This process is also known as data munging or data wrangling. We also performed data cleaning operations like currency normalization, handling invalidvalues etc. to make it ready for our dashboard.

# Dashboard building:
I then finally build the tableau dashboard for our sales insights project and published the dashboard to tableau online.
